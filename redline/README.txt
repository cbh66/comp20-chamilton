The loading of the Google map has been succesfully implemented.
I am unable to use AJAX to acquire the MBTA data became of the Same-Origin
Policy.  No client-side JavaScript can do it, for the same reason,
unless it is hosted on the same domain as the MBTA.
The page has been tested in Chrome and Firefox.

I collaborated somewhat with Maretta and asked Andrew Dempsey for help
regarding the Same-Domain Origin Policy, which he did not think was avoidable.
I spent approximately 3 hours on this assignment
