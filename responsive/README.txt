Comp 20 Lab 4, Fall 2014
Written by Colin Hamilton
Created September 28, 2014

All aspects of this lab have been, to the best of my knowledge, implemented correctly.  The page index.html appears to respond exactly as specified in the assignment.
I collaborated with no one on this lab, using only the links provided for guidance, and the Google to find certain CSS properties.
I spent approximately one hour on this assignment.
