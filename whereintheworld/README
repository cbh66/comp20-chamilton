Comp 20 Assignment 3
Colin Hamilton, Fall 2014

Every aspect of the assignment has been correctly written and tested in Chrome
and Firefox.

I store reverse-geolocated positions (when they can be found) in the
database along with the other information for efficiency: it makes sense
to only calculate that once when it is submitted, rather than every time
a request is made for the home page.  This way each request takes constant
time, rather than the alternative where a home-page request would be linear
in the size of the database.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment (though used Google
to find some of the things I used, including reverse geolocation).

I spent approximately 7 hours on this project.
