Comp 20 Assignment 4
Written by Colin Hamilton, Tufts University

Every aspect of this assignment has been correctly implemented.
I collaborated only with Susannah Church, my partner, to acquire the source
code.  I also used ideas presented in class to guide my tests.  Finally, I
used the example report by Gabe Joseph (which itself uses styling from GitHub)
as a reference for formatting my own report.

I spent approximately 6 hours on this assignment.
