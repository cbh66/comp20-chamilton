Comp 20 Assignment 2, Fall 2014
Written by: Colin Hamilton

To the best of my knowledge, all aspects of this assignment have been properly
implemented, including posting my location, adding markers for students and
characters, displaying info boxes for each, and displaying lines and distances
to characters.
I do not display the "note" field in the info box unless it has actually been
set for that particular character; without that check, "note: undefined" would
frequently be displayed.

The page has been tested in Firefox and Chrome.
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.
