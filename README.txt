This git repository is a collection of labs and assignments from my time in
Tufts Web Programming, Fall 2014.

My favorite assignment was assignment 3, because it showed how to write
server code, which I has never done before; it also allowed me to do cool
things with reverse geolocation and building HTML pages on the fly.

Since the start of this course, I feel that I have gained a deeper
understanding of how to build large systems (assignments 2 through 4 in
particular helped to build that).  I also have more appreciation for security
concerns, which before I had not given much thought to.

Security is the most important thing I have learned in this course.  The
number of vulnerabilities we could find in assignment 3 showed how important
security considerations are.  For our group project, we made sure to
consider such vulnerabilities and incorporate measures against them.

Having finished this course, I would like to delve more deeply into security.
