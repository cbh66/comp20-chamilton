Comp 20 Lab 5, Fall 2014
Written by: Colin Hamilton

All aspects of this assignment have been properly implemented to the best of
my knowledge.
The CSS file does some formatting, though I felt that not too much was needed.
The JavaScript itself is what primarily manipulates the elements' content
and style.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
I spent approximately 7 hours on this assignment (most of which was listening
to the song over and over; it's very catchy).
